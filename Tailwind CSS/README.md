# This-is-Tailwind CSS

⛏️ Trying to mine Tailwind CSS before it being minified for learning purposes. <br />
©️ This is the work of Tailwind team, I (https://github.com/Kirubel-Eshetu) am just trying to learn how Tailwind CSS is written by converting the source code into a regular javascript code. (Since TailwindCSS is made up with a bunch of JavaScript code).

🔗 Linked with the logo of Tailwind CSS you can find the offical site below :)
