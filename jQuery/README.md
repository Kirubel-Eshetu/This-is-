# This-is-jQuery

⛏️ Trying to mine jQuery before being minified for learning purposes.
©️ This is the work of jQuery team, I (https://github.com/Kirubel-Eshetu)) am just trying to learn how jQuery is written by converting the source code into a regular javascript code. (Since jQuery is made up with a bunch of JavaScript code).

🔗 Linked with the logo of jQuery you can find the offical site below :)
