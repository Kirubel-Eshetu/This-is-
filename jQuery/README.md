# this-is-jQuery
⛏️ Trying to mine jQuery before being minified for learning purposes.
©️ This is the work of jQuery team, I (https://github.com/Kirubel-Eshetu)) am just trying to learn how jQuery is written by converting the source code into a regular javascript code. (Since jQuery is made up with a bunch of JavaScript code).

🖼 Logo and link🔗 of jQuery can found below :)
