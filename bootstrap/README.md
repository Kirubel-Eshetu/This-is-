# this-is-bootstrap

📏 Here I am trying to see the structure of BootStrap after structuring it to vanilla CSS. Since bootstrap was minified.
©️ This is the work of Bootstrap team, I (https://github.com/Kirubel-Eshetu) am just trying to learn how Bootstrap is written by converting the source code into a regular css code. (Since BootStrap is made up with a bunch of CSS code).

🖼 Logo of Bootstrap found below :)
